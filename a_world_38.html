                <h2>Putin critic Navalny put on trial again in Russia</h2>
                <time datetime="2022-01-01">today</time>

        <div>
            <p><strong>A new trial against jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has begun inside the maximum-security prison east of the capital, Moscow, where he is held.</strong></p>
            <p>Navalny is accused of fresh fraud charges. He has already spent a year behind bars after surviving a poison attack that he blames on the Kremlin.</p>
            <p>He is currently serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence.</p>
            <p>This latest trial could see his prison time extended by more than a decade.</p>
            <p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the new charges "dubious", and said Navalny and his associates are "targeted for their work to shine a light on official corruption". He called on the Russian authorities to release the prisoner.</p>
            <p>Navalny, 45, was detained when he returned to Russia in January 2021, after months of treatment in Germany for a near-fatal Novichok nerve agent attack in Siberia.</p>
            <p>The following month he was jailed for three-and-a-half years for violating the conditions of a suspended sentence in an embezzlement case. Navalny insists the charges were politically motivated but he could not have met the conditions anyway as he was in a coma for some of the time.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The new charges allege that he stole $4.7m (Â£3.5m) of donations given to his political organisations.</p>
            <p>They carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.</p>
            <p>"You're going to increase my term indefinitely. What can we do about it?" Navalny said during the court hearing.</p>
            <p>"The activities of people are more important than the fate of one individual. I'm not afraid."</p>
            <p>His wife, Yuliya Navalnaya, was at the hearing at the jail in Pokrov, having demanded access to the closed-door proceedings a day earlier.</p>
            <p>A prosecutor accused Navalny and his allies of "misleading citizens" with the "deliberate" aim of stealing funds.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>His close colleague Leonid Volkov tweeted that for a change Navalny was not being tried inside the usual "cage". That was because the whole court was a cage as it was inside his penal colony, he said.</p>
            <p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the new case was "incompatible" with the rule of law, speaking at a news conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.</p>
            <p>Amnesty International described the hearing as a "sham trial, attended by prison guards rather than the media".</p>
            <p>"It's obvious that the Russian authorities intend to ensure that Mr Navalny doesn't leave prison any time soon," it said in a statement on Monday.</p>
            <p>Navalny spearheaded an anti-corruption foundation called FBK that highlighted graft in Mr Putin's United Russia party and published a widely viewed video alleging that the president's rich associates gave him a luxurious Black Sea palace.</p>
            <p>Last year, a court in Moscow banned FBK and political organisations linked to him, classifying them as "extremist".</p>
            <p>Dozens of his foundation's regional staff have faced criminal charges and many of his colleagues have left Russia to go into exile.</p>
