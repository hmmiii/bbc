        <div>
            <p><strong>World leaders have pledged to end and reverse deforestation by 2030.</strong></p>
            <p>But in Brazil's Amazon rainforest it has hit its highest level in over 15 years - and progress elsewhere is challenging.</p>
            <h3>Brazil: Illegal logging continues</h3>
            <p>Some 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil, and it plays a vital role in absorbing harmful CO2 that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>After falling steadily since 2004, deforestation in Brazil's Amazon has risen again, according to the country's National Space Research Institute (INPE).</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Amazon deforestation highest since 2006</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Its latest report found that deforestation increased by 22% in the last year, with 13,235 sq km (5,110 sq miles) of forest lost.</p>
            <p>Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been criticised for "anti-environment" policies, such as encouraging agriculture and mining in the Amazon.</p>
            <p>He has cut the funding for the government agencies that are responsible for prosecuting farmers and loggers who break environmental law. Fines for illegal logging fell by 20% in 2020.</p>
            <p>Exact figures are not available, but recent studies suggest as much as 94% of deforestation and habitat destruction in Brazil could be illegal.</p>
            <p>Brazil is not the only country responsible for the deforestation of the Amazon - neighbouring countries, including Bolivia, also contribute.</p>
            <p>Last year, Bolivia lost almost 300,000 hectares of tropical forest - the fourth-highest in the world.</p>

            </figure>
            <h3>Congo basin: Agriculture and mining</h3>
            <p>The Congo forest basin is the second-largest rainforest in the world. More than half of it lies within the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
            <p>Environmental campaign group Greenpeace says illegal logging - by both large and small companies - is leading to deforestation. Although the US and EU have banned importing illegal timber, it still gets smuggled outside the country.</p>
            <p>Other threats include small-scale subsistence agriculture, clearing for charcoal and fuel, urban expansion and mining.</p>

                <figcaption>Primary forest loss in the Democratic Repubic of Congo, 2001 to 2020</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In the past five years, the annual loss of primary forest has been nearly half a million hectares, according to Global Forest Watch.</p>
            <p>President Felix Tshisekedi last month ordered an audit of some of the leases allocated to harvest public forests - including one for more than 1.4 million hectares - amid allegations of corruption. The move was welcomed by campaigners.</p>
            <p>But earlier this year, the government also announced a plan to lift a ban dating back to 2002 on new logging operations - although it has not yet been implemented.</p>
            <p>Greenpeace says that would contradict commitments made earlier this year to protect the forest and increase forest cover by 8%.</p>
            <h3>Indonesia: Palm oil plantations</h3>
            <p>Indonesia has been among the world's top five countries for forest loss for the past two decades.</p>
            <p>According to data from Global Forest Watch, the country lost 9.75 million hectares of primary forest between 2002 and 2020.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Indonesia has lost nearly 10 million hectares of forest in 20 years</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>President Joko Widodo pledged in 2014 to crack down on deforestation by tackling the main contributor - clearing land for oil palm plantations.</p>
            <p>Up to 80% of fires were set for this purpose, according to official data.</p>
            <p>In 2016, a record 929,000 hectares of forest disappeared, but there's been a steady decrease in the rate of deforestation since then.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Getty Image</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>By 2020, the annual loss was down to 270,000 hectares.</p>
            <p>In 2019, President Widodo issued a three-year moratorium on new forest clearance, covering about 66 million hectares of primary forest and peatland. This was extended indefinitely this year.</p>
            <h3>What is the plan to stop deforestation?</h3>
            <p>Forests absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a major contributor to global warming - so cutting down trees can have a big impact on climate change.</p>
            <p>The UN says 420 million hectares (one billion acres) of forest have been lost since 1990. Agriculture is the main reason for this.</p>
            <p>More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, at the COP26 summit.</p>
            <p>There have been efforts to protect forests before.</p>
            <p>In 2014 the UN announced a deal to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030.</p>
            <p>Then, in 2017, it set another target to increase forested land by 3% worldwide by 2030.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>The World forests are still decreasing in size</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>But deforestation continued at "an alarming rate", according to a 2019 report, with serious consequences for the fight against climate change.</p>
            <p>There has been some reforestation, through natural growth or planting, but trees need years to mature before they can fully absorb CO2.</p>
            <p>Over the past decade 4.7 million hectares of forest were still lost annually - with Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia among the countries worst affected.</p>
