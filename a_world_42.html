                <h2>Single's Inferno: Why 'fake' rich girl Song Ji-a enraged South Korea</h2>
                <time datetime="2022-01-01">today</time>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p><strong>She was cancelled for wearing fake designer clothes - barely considered a sin in the West, but it destroyed Song Ji-a's career in her homeland. The scandal however wasn't just another tale of a cancelled celebrity - it tapped into a deeper social angst felt by young South Koreans.</strong></p>
            <p>The moment she appeared on Netflix's hit Korean dating show Single's Inferno, she turned heads.</p>
            <p>Song Ji-a, a beauty influencer in her 20s, was the alluring screen siren. As she stepped down the path towards the other contestants, the cameras zoomed in, and the music slowed.</p>
            <p>She quickly became known as the fashionable 'it' girl. And she was popular with the boys.</p>
            <p>Warning: There are plot spoilers ahead.</p>
            <p>Ji-a received the most date invites, and the most requests for intimate walks. The show even presented one lovesick candidate waiting for hours in the sun for her return.</p>
            <p>In the finale, she had three of the show's five men lined up on a beach vying for her hand. She was the breakout star.</p>
            <p>The social media influencer had already been popular in South Korea prior to the show. But her following soared after her Netflix debut - to 3.7 million followers on Instagram and nearly two million on YouTube.</p>
            <p>That first week of January 2022 represented the peak of her fame. Her downfall came soon after.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Song Ji-a was one of the most popular contestants on Singles Inferno</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Internet sleuths began to pick her apart. They accused her of wearing fake designer clothes. They seized on a pink Chanel knit that was slightly the wrong shade.</p>
            <p>Netizens pointed out other elements of her wardrobe - and within days she had to respond to the allegations.</p>
            <p>Song Ji-a admitted that she had worn knock-offs. But she claimed to have not known they were copies, saying she had bought them because they looked "pretty".</p>
            <p>The flimsy explanation failed to quell the rage.</p>
            <p>Netizens delved further into her background, poring over her previous YouTube videos. They earmarked suspect goods and questioned whether she owned the luxury apartment she lived in.</p>
            <p>And then there were the Chinese videos, clips where she said she was learning Mandarin, and where she referred to the national Korean dish kimchi as pao cai, a Chinese term for pickled vegetables.</p>
            <p>Fans accused her of pandering to the Chinese market, with some even calling her a traitor.</p>
            <p>Other Korean TV shows began editing out her cameos. And her celebrity friends, other actors and influencers, deleted their own Instagram pictures showing them hanging out with Ji-a.</p>
            <p>A week after her first apology, Ji-a posted another video where she said she "deeply regretted her actions", calling herself "pathetic".</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Ji-a wore black and no make-up in her mournful apology video</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>She wiped her social accounts, leaving only the apology posts. She'd become known as a national disgrace.</p>
            <p>But to the rest of the world, the reaction seemed overblown. How had a scandal about counterfeit clothes spiralled into a full-blown witch-hunt?</p>
            <h3>Born with a 'gold spoon'?</h3>
            <p>Netizens accused Ji-a of various offences, from "undermining" hard-working designers to singlehandedly damaging a brand's value.</p>
            <p>"But actually the biggest crime alleged was that she was a fake - and that she pretended to be something that she is not. That was the issue that kept being raised time and time again," said Se-Woong Koo, the editor of Korean Exposé, a subscription-based newsletter focusing on contemporary Korea.</p>
            <p>While non-Korean fans just saw her as just a luxury influencer, Koreans believed she had presented as something more. Many local followers had thought her to be a geumsujeo or "gold spoon".</p>
            <p>Derived from the English expression that refers to those born into privilege "with a silver spoon in their mouth", a "gold spoon" is someone from the top 1% of high-income households in South Korea.</p>
            <p>It's often used to refer to the children of super-rich families. The term "dirt spoons" represents the other end of the spectrum.</p>
            <p>"That's what made her attractive - not that she was a hardworking influencer, or that she was successful on her own and making a lot of money. People said they were following her because they thought she was a gold spoon," said Mr Koo.</p>
            <p>Technically, Ji-a had never claimed to be a "gold spoon" heiress. In a July 2021 interview, she had denied that label but acknowledged she'd grown up in a comfortably affluent household.</p>
            <p>But as an influencer, she'd built a profile based on a luxury aesthetic. People assumed she was a rich girl, and she didn't correct them.</p>
            <p>"People feel like they've been cheated," said Michelle Ho, a women's studies assistant professor at the National University of Singapore.</p>
            <p>Commentators say this backlash against Ji-a is rooted in the underlying class tensions of modern South Korean society.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Ji-a showed off her luxury apartment and other aspects of her life on social media</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>That's reflected in not only Korean politics but also pop culture. Films and TV dramas like Parasite and Squid Game have highlighted the "gold spoon-dirt spoon" divide.</p>
            <p>Korean millennials, like their peers in many developed countries, are bearing the brunt of increasing class inequality.</p>
            <p>These days, it's near impossible for a young Korean to buy a home on an average company salary.</p>
            <p>A growing number no longer trust that hard work will deliver dues; many instead believe that success in life depends on the family you're born into.</p>
            <p>Education is also no longer the great social leveller, when some 70% of school-leavers go on to university. People's faith in the university system has also been tarnished by nepotism scandals.</p>
            <p>"We're now at the point where some people genuinely believe that Korea does not offer social mobility," Mr Koo said.</p>
            <p>"The only way to be well-off is to have rich parents or to marry money. And as a result, many people aspire to belong to that 'gold spoon' generation who appear to have it so easy."</p>
            <p>In other words there's a bitter fascination with people who can glide through life.</p>
            <p>When an ordinary Korean youth decides to follow a "rich girl" like Ji-a, their fixation goes beyond just a materialist admiration.</p>
            <p>"People lived their lives vicariously through her, they aspired to the fantasy," said Dr Ho.</p>
            <p>"And so when it was exposed that she was a sham, their aspirations broke down as well."</p>
