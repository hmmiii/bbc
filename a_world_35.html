                <h2>Dozens more graves found at former residential school sites</h2>

            <p><strong>An indigenous nation in Canada says it has discovered evidence of 54 unmarked graves at the sites of two former residential schools in Saskatchewan.</strong></p>
            <p>Keeseekoose First Nation said the graves were found near Fort Pelly and St Phillip's residential schools.</p>
            <p>It is the latest finding amid a wave that has triggered a national debate over the residential school system.</p>
            <p>Indigenous investigations across the country have found evidence of more than 1,100 graves since last spring.</p>
            <p>Just weeks ago, the Williams Lake First Nation announced it had found evidence of 93 unmarked graves on the grounds of St Joseph Mission, a former residential school.</p>
            <p>These government-funded compulsory boarding schools were part of a policy meant to assimilate indigenous children and destroy indigenous cultures and languages.</p>
            <p>Some 150,000 First Nations, Métis and Inuit children were taken from their families during this period and placed in these schools.</p>
            <p>Survivors had long testified that children who died at the schools were buried in unmarked plots, now being rediscovered throughout the country.</p>
            <p>Ted Quewezance, project leader of the Keeseekoose's search, said ground-penetrating radar technology suggested there were 42 grave sites at the grounds of Fort Pelly Residential School, and an additional 12 at St Phillip's.</p>
            <p>At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Quewezance said the discovery matched testimony of residential school survivors.</p>
            <p>"It was not that they could not hear, but [that] they did not believe our survivors," he said.</p>
            <p>Chief Lee Kitchimonia said that wintry weather would delay the investigation of the site.</p>
            <p>"It's going to be a very tough time... knowing we have unmarked graves in our community, where we walk every day, drive every day," he said, according to CBC News.</p>
            <p>"We passed by them, never realising that there were graves there."</p>
            <p>Fort Pelley was open as a residential school from 1905-13.</p>
            <p>The St Phillip's building was used as a boarding house for students from 1902-14 before it was shut due to poor conditions.</p>
            <p>It was re-opened in 1927 as a residential school and, like the majority of Canada's residential schools, was run by the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>Both were in eastern Saskatchewan.</p>
            <p>More than 130 residential schools were operated in Canada between 1874 and 1996.</p>
            <p>Conditions inside the schools were abhorrent. School buildings were often poorly built, poorly heated and unsanitary, and children were subject to emotional, physical and sexual abuse.</p>
            <p>The landmark Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report, released in 2015, concluded Canada's residential school system amounted to "cultural genocide".</p>
            <p>At least 3,200 children died while attending a residential school, though advocates have said this number is likely much higher. Former TRC chair Murray Sinclair estimated some 6,000 children may have never made it home.</p>
