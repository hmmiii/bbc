            <p><strong>Rafael Fernandez Caballero has been named Underwater Photographer of the Year 2022 for his image of five whale sharks feeding together in the Maldives.</strong></p>

            </figure>
            <p>This is a special moment, capturing the meeting of the seagrass shrimp and the seagrass pipefish in Spanish waters.</p>
            <p>Both species live on the leaves of seagrasses.</p>
            <p>The pipefish looks like a seagrass leaf - and for this reason, some prawns merge with its body, thinking they are leaves that move.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The wreck of Tyrifjord is one of the favourite wrecks in the Gulen dive-resort area of Norway.</p>
            <p>It sits approximately 40m (130ft) underwater and is very sheltered.</p>
            <p>The highlight of the wreck is always the huge steering wheel in the aft.</p>

                </figure>
            </figure>
            <p>This love pond is a 20-minute drive from my home [in Finland] and it has rewarded me plentifully over the past 10 years.</p>
            <p>It was full of love in late April 2021.</p>
            <p>I spent four days and four nights wearing a dry suit, lots of undergarments and a heated vest, to survive in the 5C water.</p>
            <p>I floated and stayed put among the frogs - and quite soon, they accepted me and my camera as part of the scenery.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Our idea was to create a completely black silhouette in the foreground - but at the same time, make eye contact with the viewer.</p>
            <p>To make the hair glow in the underwater studio, three powerful strobes were hidden in the background.</p>

                <figcaption>Black and white: Sarah's Underwater World, by Kerrie Burow, from Australia</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This shot was taken a year into the coronavirus pandemic - my seven-year-old niece Sarah stares with wonder while on one breath underwater.</p>
            <p>The scene portrays the therapeutic power of water, which so many of us experienced during the pandemic.</p>
            <p>I minimalised my presence, gave no instructions to Sarah and allowed the scene to evolve naturally.</p>

            <p>Once a year, at the end of March, it is mating time for the toads.</p>
            <p>I was trying to take a split shot with this toad [in a pond in Leipzig, Germany], when he started to crawl on my small dome port.</p>

            <p>I first met Jeniya having breakfast at one of my favourite food spots in Koh Tao, Thailand.</p>
            <p>After a couple of months, we met again, at Sairee beach.</p>
            <p>She was wearing a stunning long white dress and we planned to shoot mostly split shots with the sunset, using strobes to illuminate the underwater scene.</p>
            <p>It was a pretty challenging shot, since I didn't have any fins or wetsuit.</p>
            <p>What I like about this photograph is the imperfection of backscatter, recreating space and making it perfect to me.</p>

                <figcaption>British waters wide angle: Gannet Storm, by Henley Spiers, from the UK</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>A northern gannet swims in an artistic hail of bubbles created by diving seabirds in Shetland.</p>
            <p>Hitting the frigid water faster than an Olympic diver, these incredible birds have evolved air sacs in the head and chest to survive these repeated heavy impacts.</p>
            <p>From underwater, the sound was thunderous, as streamlined white torpedoes pierced the surface.</p>
            <p>I wanted to create a novel image of these handsome seabirds and resolved to try to capture their movement through a slow exposure.</p>

            <p>We were diving on an area of reef in Loch Carron, Ross-shire, I'd not previously explored.</p>
            <p>After an excited squeal and waving of a torch in my direction, I dropped down to see my buddy had found not one but two beautiful little Yarrell's blennies holed up in a crack in the rock.</p>

            <p>In the summer months, jellyfish frequent the British Isles in large numbers, thought to be attracted by the warmer waters.</p>
            <p>The summer of 2021 was no exception and there were huge numbers of these compass jellyfish in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall.</p>
            <p>I hope my image can inspire others to explore and appreciate the wonders found right in our backyard, in British waters.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Living from shallow water to deep water and reaching impressive sizes, spiny starfish are abundant in Cornwall.</p>
            <p>I've often taken photos of them underwater - but on a low tide, they can be found in the exposed rock pools.</p>
            <p>I attached a fisheye wet lens and was lucky with bright conditions.</p>
            <p>After a while, I came across a large starfish in a gully flanked by exposed kelp.</p>

            <p>An aerial perspective of busy anchovy fishing activities off the coast of Hon Yen, Phu Yen province, Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Salted anchovy is the most important raw material to create traditional Vietnamese fish sauce, but anchovies are a little fish with a big impact.</p>
            <p>When they are over-fished, the whales, tunas, sea birds, and other marine predators that rely on them as a dietary staple, face starvation and population decline.</p>
