            <p><strong>Coronavirus has changed the way we travel and many countries now demand proof of a negative Covid test before letting you in - with tests often costing hundreds of pounds.

            <p>Coronavirus has changed the way we travel and many countries now demand proof of a negative Covid test before letting you in - with tests often costing hundreds of pounds. BBC reporter Joice Etutu has been speaking to two women who admit using and selling fake certificates.</p>
            <p>"When I got to the counter where they check in your passport before you board the plane, the man asked me for my [Covid-19 test certificate]</p>
            <p>"He literally read through it for no more than 10 to 20 seconds, and then he smiled and asked me where I was going and said, 'have a safe flight.'</p>
            <p>"I was relieved because I knew once I passed that stage, I was free."</p>
            <p>24-year-old Louise* travelled to Ghana in October using a fake negative Covid-19 test certificate - the documentation some countries require to prove you don't have the virus and are fit to fly before you leave.</p>
            <p>Ghana is one of those countries and Louise says she needed to travel there for work and couldn't afford the cost of the test. They can cost between £100 to £300, so she looked into getting a fake certificate.</p>
            <p>"I just asked people I knew, 'who does photoshop?' I asked my friends to see their Covid tests just to get a structure of what the certificate looks like and then had someone make one for me."</p>
            <p>Buying or even attempting to buy a forged certificate is a crime in the UK and using a forged certificate to travel is fraud by false representation. If you're caught selling fake certificates in the UK, you might face a prison sentence.</p>
            <p>Currently, it's the responsibility of airlines to check that passengers have a negative test result.</p>

            <p>Jessica* is also 24. She admits to selling fake Covid-19 certificates to people who wanted to travel abroad by advertising her services on social media.</p>
            <p>She says it was "easy money".</p>
            <p>"They just didn't want to pay £150 for a private test," she says. "We charged them £50.</p>
            <p>"Because it was so cheap people were asking so many questions, like 'how does it work?', 'when I get to the place are they gonna double check?', 'how did you do it?', 'am I gonna get in trouble?'"</p>
            <p>Jessica justified the fraudulent activity to herself by saying she is a single parent.</p>
            <p>"No one's helping me, no one's giving me money.</p>
            <p>"If I have to take a small risk to make like £300 to feed my kid, trust me I'll do it."</p>
            <p>Jessica realised there was a market for forged test certificates after needing one to travel herself. Not wanting to pay the fee for a private test, her friend told her she knew someone who had a forged certificate, and so she decided to set up a similar scheme.</p>
            <p>In total, Jessica admits to selling eight fake certificates but she decided to stop when she realised the impact Covid-19 was having on people's lives.</p>
            <p>"I feel bad now. [I'm] someone that works within the healthcare [sector] so obviously I don't want that on my conscience.</p>
            <p>"People are getting Corona because of me. In other countries that don't have the opportunity of medical care like we have here."</p>
            <h3>'I saved £200 to £250 by using a forged certificate'</h3>
            <p>"For me it was more for financial reasons," says Louise about her fraudulent activity. "It wasn't necessarily that I didn't want to take the test.</p>
            <p>"It wasn't feasible... and I know some people may be thinking 'so why are you travelling?'</p>
            <p>"I saved about £200 to £250 by using a forged certificate."</p>
            <p>Like Jessica, Louise knew she was committing fraud, but she admits she would do it again.</p>
            <p>"Until there's some type of Covid computer that can track which clinic or hospital somebody got a test in, I don't see why I should worry myself."</p>
            <p>Currently, there are only anecdotal examples to demonstrate the scale of this issue.</p>
            <p>Europol recently warned about the use of false test certificates, blaming criminal gangs.</p>
            <p>Europol recently warned about the use of false test certificates, blaming criminal gangs.</p>
            <p>A man was arrested at Luton airport last month under suspicion of selling fake certificates.</p>
            <p>And in Paris, French authorities recently arrested seven people at Charles de Gaulle airport. It's claimed they were carrying 200 counterfeit tests on digital devices.</p>

            <p>The UK government says you can provide proof of your negative test with a printed document, an email or a text message.</p>
            <p>The proof has to include your personal details, the date the test was done, and the name of the test provider and their contact details.</p>
            <p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade association for the world's airlines, has come up with a possible solution for spotting fake certificates.</p>
            <p>They've suggested the idea for a new "IATA travel pass app", says Alan Murray Hayden who is Head of Airport Passenger and Security Products at IATA.</p>
            <p>The passenger creates a profile based on their passport details. When they get their test results, the laboratories can send them to the passenger as a "verifiable credential," meaning the passenger can't alter or change the test results and those results are linked to their identity.</p>
            <p>In a statement, the Department for Transport says pre-departure testing is in place to protect the health of the UK public and those attempting to cheat the system are selfishly gambling with the lives of others.</p>
