            <p><strong>Like millions of people around the world, the pandemic spurred Joe Flynn to reassess his career.</strong></p>
            <p>The 34-year-old from Worcestershire had spent 10 years selling mortgages, but during the lockdowns of the past 21 months he started to re-evaluate what he wanted to do with his life.</p>
            <p>"The buy-to-let mortgage sector wasn't something I ever thought I wanted to do, but it was a good career with strong personal development," he says.</p>
            <p>"I realised that I instead wanted a career where I felt I could make a difference about something I cared about."</p>
            <p>Inspired by some previous volunteering work, Mr Flynn found a website called CharityJob, which lists vacancies in the sector. A role at The Vegan Society caught his eye.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Working from home made many people realise that the only thing they liked about their job was socialising with colleagues</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>"It was perfect, being vegan myself for eight years," he says.</p>
            <p>Now three months into his managerial role, Mr Flynn is enthusiastic about his new employer. "Everyone is so passionate here, and wants to push the organisation forward. It's really motivating.''</p>
            <p>However, he admits that taking a "significant pay cut" did make him question whether it was the right move. "But I thought about what my ethics are, and what I want to be doing," he says.</p>
            <p>"I thought I'd forever regret not taking the opportunity. You can't put a value on job satisfaction when you're dealing with an organisation where the morals and ethics align with your own."</p>
            <p>With more focus than ever on topics such as climate change, sustainability, and equality, younger generations in particular are more intent on finding a career with a positive social impact.</p>
            <p>Throw the pandemic into the mix, and the trend towards a purpose-led career has accelerated.</p>
            <p>Seven out of 10 people say that coronavirus has made them re-evaluate their career path, according to new report by Escape the City, an organisation that helps people leave the corporate sector.</p>
            <p>Its study also found that 89% of respondents now "wanted a career with a strong sense of purpose". That compares with 71% in the pre Covid-19 world.</p>
            <p>Skye Robertson, chief operating officer at Escape the City, says the pandemic has shifted people's desires for their careers.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Skye Robertson says it is possible to find a new job that has a positive impact, without taking a cut in salary</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>"It's been a period of reflection for people to think about their lives and work, and what matters to them," she says. "People are flocking to purposeful careers."</p>
            <p>Ms Robertson adds that with many people having got used to working from home since March 2020, the social aspect that kept many people tied to their jobs has significantly weakened.</p>
            <p>Habiba Islam is a career advisor at 80,000 Hours, a not-for-profit organisation that provides resources on how individuals can make the most social impact during their working life.</p>
            <p>"For most people, their career is the biggest way they can have a positive impact," she says. "The pandemic, and the changes it made to work, prompted people to think about their career choice, and what they want to do.</p>
            <p>"But there were other factors at play. The other aspect is facing a global catastrophe. That turns people's attention to bigger world problems, thinking that maybe they could be working on preventing the next Covid, perhaps."</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">

            <p>Yasmina Kone, 27, was managing graduate recruitment at a law firm when Covid struck.</p>
            <p>"The pandemic was an interesting time," she says. "There was so much time sitting behind a screen, which made me focus on who was benefiting from my work, and how I was using my skills.</p>
            <p>"There was widespread suffering as a result of the pandemic, and I started to realise that I wanted to have a more direct impact on vulnerable communities."</p>
            <p>So in May 2021, Ms Kone quit her job to become a manager at Beam, a social enterprise helping homeless people find jobs.</p>
            <p>She says her new role has been motivating when the world has felt like "a dark place... now I'm changing people's lives,"</p>
            <p>Ms Kone admits she did take a pay cut for the role. However, she says it's been worth it. "Every day I get to help people. That's mental motivation, plus there's unlimited holiday, and share options."</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <figcaption>Yasmina Kone is now helping unemployed people find work</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Ms Robertson insists that it is possible for a person to move to a more socially purposeful job without having to see his or her wages go down.</p>
            <p>"We have heard people say that there's a 'moral tax' [when leaving a corporate job for one with purpose], with massive salary cuts or having to work to the bones at a charity but that's not the case anymore," says Ms Robertson.</p>
            <p>She points to the growth of so-called "B Corps" businesses - firms of all sizes that have pledged to balance profit with purpose, and to consider their impact on both the wider community and the environment.</p>
            <p>"There's now hundreds of B Corps... offering purposeful careers," says Ms Robertson.</p>
