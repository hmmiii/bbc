                <h2>Recordings show lockdown London quieter than 1928</h2>
                <time datetime="2022-01-01">today</time>

        <div>
            <p><strong>Recordings of silent London streets during the lockdown are to become part of the collection of the Museum of London.</strong></p>
            <p>These soundscapes will be kept in a project capturing the experiences of Covid-19.</p>
            <p>They are being made available online alongside sound recordings of the same London streets from 1928.</p>
            <p>And it shows how the lockdown streets of 2020 were far quieter than almost a century before.</p>
            <p>The recordings of London's streets in 1928, being made publicly available on the museum's website, were gathered in the middle of outrage over excessive traffic noise.</p>
            <p>An anti-noise pollution campaign, spearheaded by the Daily Mail, complained about "irritating" and "unnecessary" hooting - and criticised the "screeching" and noisy acceleration of "so-called sports cars" in London's West End.</p>
            <p>The newspaper, which gathered recordings with the Columbia Graphophone Company, warned of hospital patients being unable to sleep and the constant sounds of "engines, bells and whistles".</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The September 1928 recordings published by the Museum of London include a commentary picking out the brakes of a "motorbus" or the rumble of a "motorcoach", alongside the rattle of horse-drawn carriages.</p>
            <p>"There's a motor bicycle without a proper silencer," says the commentator.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the recordings from May 2020, at London locations such as Piccadilly, Brompton Road and Leman Street, show the emptiness of streets during the Covid-19 lockdown.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>There are cars still audible, but they are separate enough to be distinguished, with gaps in between rather than a constant roar.</p>
            <p>And the recordings, gathered by the Strings and Tins group of sound engineers, show that even in a much emptier city, there is still a wash of background noise.</p>
            <p>The reduction in traffic noise and the absence of flights overhead became a talking point during the lockdown, with suggestions that it was a return to a much quieter time.</p>
            <p>But that quieter time was not 1928, according to the museum's recordings.</p>
            <p>In clipped tones, the commentator, a former naval officer, takes issue with the blaring horns and says how difficult it was to cross (pronounced "craws") the road.</p>

            <p>Even though car ownership in the 1920s was much less common than now, driving was much more dangerous.</p>
            <p>The first official road death figures were gathered in 1926 - and there were almost 4,900 fatalities, compared with about 1,900 in 2019.</p>
            <p>Foteini Aravani, the Museum of London's digital curator, said the 1928 recordings were made when the "effects of sound pollution in central London were only starting to be understood".</p>

                <figcaption>Sound engineers captured the absence of traffic in central London</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>A century later, she says the challenge was to record the absence of sound, which had become a "distinct aspect of London in lockdown".</p>
            <p>"We felt it was our responsibility to capture this rare and significant moment to not only contrast the 1928 recordings, but to also provide a record of London's rarely 'silent streets' for future generations," said Ms Aravani.</p>
            <p>Or as the Daily Mail said in 1928: "We have become so used to the perpetual noise around us that many of us fail to appreciate what our poor brains are being called upon to endure."</p>
