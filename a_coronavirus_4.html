            <p><strong>The Duchess of Cornwall is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19, Clarence House has confirmed.</strong></p>
            <p>Her husband, the Prince of Wales, tested positive for the virus on Thursday but Camilla, 74, carried out three public engagements on that day after testing negative.</p>
            <p>Prince Charles met with the Queen two days before he tested positive.</p>
            <p>Last week Buckingham Palace said the Queen had no Covid symptoms and on Monday said it had nothing to add.</p>
            <p>It is the first time the duchess has caught coronavirus, while Prince Charles has the virus for a second time.</p>
            <p>A Clarence House spokesman said they would follow government guidelines.</p>
            <p>On Thursday, the duchess described herself as "luckily" negative, during a visit to Thames Valley Partnership in Buckinghamshire, saying of her testing regime: "I've taken it so many times".</p>
            <p>As well as the visit to Buckinghamshire, Camilla visited the Haven Paddington sexual assault referral centre in west London and opened the Nourish Hub community kitchen in Shepherd's Bush - where she added the finishing touches to a Loobia Polo, an Iranian rice dish, that was being offered to refugees.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>On Monday morning, Clarence House alerted the organisations Camilla visited and the media who covered her engagements.</p>
            <p>The encounter between Prince Charles, 73, and his mother came when the prince visited Windsor Castle for an investiture - to meet people who had been honoured in the twice-annual honours list and officially give them their awards.</p>
            <p>Buckingham Palace has not confirmed whether the Queen has been tested, citing medical privacy, and has only said that she was showing no symptoms.</p>

            <p>With Prince Charles and Camilla having caught Covid, it shows the pandemic still has a sting in its tail, able to disrupt and cause health worries.</p>
            <p>But we don't really know whether there's a wider royal Covid outbreak or about any potential seriousness.</p>
            <p>Because when it comes to health, it's seen as a private matter.</p>
            <p>The Royal Family might have overlapping and complicated boundaries between their public roles and private identities, but for medical issues, there is a strong convention of palace aides only giving the barest of details.</p>
            <p>So even though we know the Queen didn't have Covid symptoms last week, we don't really know even whether she had a test.</p>
            <p>And the reasons for the Queen's cancellation of appearances last year were never publicly explained.</p>
            <p>There's an historical precedent for such secrecy. In the past, courts were full of rivals and monarchs didn't want to look vulnerable.</p>
            <p>Now it's about the siege of modern media, which is fended off by palace officials with a modern media cliche - that there won't be any "running commentary" about the state of the royals' health.</p>
